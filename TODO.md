## To look into

1. **The lock screen once showed the desktop in the VM.** On 2026-09-27 xss-lock's `i3lock` had been running for two hours in `void-vm` (picom on xrender with the 0.23.0 starter), yet screenshots showed the desktop, with the bar's clock stale, and rofi couldn't grab the keyboard. A fresh lock covered the screen in every test afterwards: with and without picom, after a notification, a new window, StumpWM rearranging, a dark screen and rofi. A second clue the same day: a picom that had run for a while in the VM stopped showing newly opened windows (rofi's area showed the wallpaper) until it was restarted, and a fresh picom was fine. So the likelier story is picom showing a stale frame, not windows above the lock; the X screen under it may well have been locked. Still to find: what makes picom stop repainting in the VM (long idle with vsync? the screen going dark for real?), and whether it ever happens on real hardware. A pen-tester review in the VM, left locked through a long idle, would settle it. Later that day, testing Lazarus (Qt5) in the VM: its newly opened windows were often left unpainted by picom (xrender), though StumpWM had them and they showed at once without picom or after restarting it; rofi was always fine. Turning off open/close fading helped once and not the second time, so that isn't it. Since then the picom starter never fades i3lock, so a lock screen can't be caught half faded in.
